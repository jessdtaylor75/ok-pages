Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. &nbsp;If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that the Company made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the Company will pay you the greater of the award or $2,500.00. &nbsp;Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney&rsquo;s fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.</span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c11">Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration</span><span class="c0">. &nbsp;If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. &nbsp;The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.</span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c11">Time Limits.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; If you or the Company pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.</span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c11">Authority of Arbitrator</span><span class="c0">. &nbsp;If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. &nbsp;The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. &nbsp;The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. &nbsp;The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. &nbsp;The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. &nbsp;The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the Company.</span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c11">Waiver of Jury Trial.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. &nbsp;In the event any litigation should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.</span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c11">Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions</span><span class="c0">. &nbsp;ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. &nbsp;</span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c11">Confidentiality</span><span class="c0">. &nbsp;All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. &nbsp;The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. &nbsp;This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.</span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c11">Severability</span><span class="c0">. &nbsp;If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c11">Right to Waive.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. &nbsp;Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.</span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c11">Survival of Agreement</span><span class="c0">. &nbsp;This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company. &nbsp;</span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c11">Small Claims Court.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or the Company may bring an individual action in small claims court.</span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c11">Emergency Equitable Relief</span><span class="c0">. &nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. &nbsp;A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.</span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c11">Claims Not Subject to Arbitration. </span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party&rsquo;s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.</span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c11">Courts.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Boulder County, Colorado, for such purpose </span></li></ol><ol class="c2 lst-kix_list_8-1" start="3"><li class="c1"><span class="c4">Export. </span><span class="c0">The Service may be subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries.
